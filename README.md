# TrueorFalse

This is the issue about input and identity. 

the story case is that someone can not identity green with blue. While he just names the true green is blue, and the true blue is green.
So it looks like no issue from the result, but it's normal case for us. 

SO HOW TO FIND THIS THE POTENTIAL ISSUE???
